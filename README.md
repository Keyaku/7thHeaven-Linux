# 7thHeaven-Linux
Installer and launcher for 7th Heaven on SteamOS and other Linux distros.
Based on [7thDeck](https://github.com/dotaxis/7thDeck), with improvements and extended Linux support.

## Purpose
This script will:
* Apply patches to FF7's proton prefix to accomodate 7th Heaven.
* Install 7th Heaven to a folder of your choosing (you must create this directory beforehand).
* Add 7th Heaven to Steam and the KDE Launcher using a custom wrapper.
* (SteamOS Only) Add a custom controller config, so you can control the mouse with the trackpad without holding down the STEAM button.
* (SteamOS Only) Install a mod to 7th Heaven which automatically sets recommended graphics settings.


## Requirements
* Steam installed and logged into an account.
* A fresh installation of FF7 via Steam.

## Prerequisites

### Ubuntu (23.10 and later)
`bwrap` needs to have the proper permissions in AppArmor. Open the terminal and follow these steps:
1. Install `apparmor-profiles`
```bash
sudo apt install apparmor-profiles
```
2. Link the `bwrap` profile to AppArmor
```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict /etc/apparmor.d/
```
3. Load the profile into AppArmor
```bash
sudo apparmor_parser /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
```

### Pop!_OS
`gawk` needs to be installed or you will encounter a syntax error when 7thDeck tries to detect FF7's installation. Open the terminal and follow these steps:
1. Install `gawk`
```bash
sudo apt install gawk
```

## Usage
1. Download and extract to a folder of your choosing.
2. Run install.sh (Right-click -> Run in Konsole).
3. Launch 7th Heaven from Steam or Desktop Shortcut.
